;;;; Encoding of strings to filenames

;; Encoding scheme based on one by Joey Hess -- File.configFileName in
;; propellor.  Try to avoid including non-alphanumerics other than '.' and '_'
;; in the filename, such that it both remains roughly human-readable and is
;; likely to be accepted by programs which don't treat filenames as opaque
;; (and interpret them with a charset sufficiently similar to Lisp's).

;; This implementation also assumes that the Lisp doing the decoding has the
;; same charset as the Lisp doing the encoding.
